701. Trim a Binary Search Tree
Given the root of a binary search tree and 2 numbers min and max,
trim the tree such that all the numbers in the new tree
are between min and max (inclusive).
The resulting tree should still be a valid binary search tree.
So, if we get this tree as input:
        8
       / \
      3   10
     / \    \
    1  6     14
      / \    /
     4   7  13

and weâ€™re given min value as 5 and max value as 13,
then the resulting binary search tree should be:

        8
       / \
      6   10
       \    \
        7    13

Example
Given binary search tree:
{8,3,10,1,6,#,14,#,#,4,7,13}
and minVal = 5, maxVal = 13.

One possible answer: {8, 6, 10, #, 7, #, 13}
