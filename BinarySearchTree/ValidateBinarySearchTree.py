95. Validate Binary Search Tree
Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
A single node tree is a BST
Example
An example:

  2
 / \
1   4
   / \
  3   5
The above binary tree is serialized as {2,1,4,#,#,3,5} (in level order).
