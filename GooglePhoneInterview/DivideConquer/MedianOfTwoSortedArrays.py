65. Median of two Sorted Arrays
There are two sorted arrays A and B of size m and n respectively.
Find the median of the two sorted arrays.

Example
Given A=[1,2,3,4,5,6] and B=[2,3,4,5], the median is 3.5.

Given A=[1,2,3] and B=[4,5], the median is 3.

Challenge
The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).
