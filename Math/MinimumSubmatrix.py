1458. Minimum Submatrix
Given a matrix arr of size n*m,
each position of the matrix has a positive or negative integer,
requiring a non-empty submatrix to be taken from the matrix
to minimize the sum of it,output the sum of the minimum submatrix.

Example
Given a = [[-3,-2,-1],[-2,3,-2],[-1,3,-1]]ï¼Œreturn -7.

 Explanation:
The upper-left corner of the submatrix is (0,0),
and the lowerright corner is (1,2). The minimum sum is -7.
Given a = [[1,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,1,1]], return 1

Explanation:
All numbers are positive,
but the submatrix cannot be empty, so we take the smallest one.
